## Deep Learning Playbook

A collection of jupyter notebooks based on my current learning on machine
learning and deep learning.

Most of the examples are based on books and other online tutorials.

The notebooks are organized based on frameworks:

## Keras

* [Simple MLP](keras/simple_mlp/simple_mlp.ipynb)

* [Binary classification with MLP](keras/binary_mlp/Binary%20MLP.ipynb)

* [Multiclass classification with MLP](keras/binary_mlp/Multiclass%20MLP.ipynb)

* [Regression with MLP](keras/binary_mlp/Regression%20MLP.ipynb)(In Progress)

* [Evaluating MLP with scikit-learn](keras/evaluate_mlp)

## Tensorflow

* [Tensorflow Intro](tensorflow/Tensorflow%20Intro.ipynb)

* [Simple Tensorflow operations from "Tensorflow For Beginners"](tensorflow/Tensoflow%20For%20Beginners.ipynb)

* [Simple Logistic Regression from "Tensorflow For Beginners"](tensorflow/Tensorflow%20For%20Beginners%20-%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
